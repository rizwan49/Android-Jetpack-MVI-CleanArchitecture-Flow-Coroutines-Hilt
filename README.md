## Android-Jetpack-MVI-Flow-Coroutines-Hilt-JetpackCompose-CleanArchitecture
This demo project showcases the integration of several modern Android development technologies and principles, providing a robust and efficient architecture.
By integrating these technologies and principles into my demo project, I have demonstrated a commitment to modern, efficient, and maintainable Android app development practices.

## Here's a summary of the key components and concepts used:

### [Orbit-MVI ](https://orbit-mvi.org/)
- Employed the Orbit-MVI pattern, a variation of Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture, to manage state and user interactions in a reactive and predictable manner.
### [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)
Utilized Kotlin's Flow library for managing asynchronous data streams, enabling seamless communication between different components of the application.
### [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)
Leveraged Kotlin Coroutines to handle asynchronous tasks and streamline concurrency, enhancing the app's responsiveness and performance.
### [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
Incorporated Android ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious manner, ensuring data persistence during configuration changes and preventing memory leaks.
### [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)
Integrated Hilt, the recommended dependency injection library for Android, to facilitate dependency injection and simplify the management of dependencies throughout the app.
### [Clean architecture](https://proandroiddev.com/clean-architecture-data-flow-dependency-rule-615ffdd79e29)
Adhered to Clean Architecture principles, separating the app into distinct layers (UI, Domain, Data) to promote modularity, scalability, and testability while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
### [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
Implemented the UI layer using Jetpack Compose, Google's modern toolkit for building native Android UIs declaratively, simplifying UI development and enhancing code readability.
### [Followed SOLID principle](https://medium.com/mindorks/solid-principles-explained-with-examples-79d1ce114ace)
Ensured adherence to the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), promoting maintainability, extensibility, and robustness of the codebase.
### [Recommended Android app architecture ](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch)
Followed Google's recommended Android app architecture guidelines, which advocate for a clear separation of concerns and the use of architecture components like ViewModel and LiveData for managing UI-related data.
